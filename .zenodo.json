    "description": "<p>This repository has been made possible by Gertim Alberda, \nwho ‘manually’ digitalized all the 389 Bach 4-voice chorales, \nas published by the <a href=\"https://imslp.org/wiki/Special:ReverseLookup/348824\">Breitkopf edition &#39;nr. 3765&#39;</a>. \nFor this he meticulously transcribed all the notes and lyrics of that edition, by using the music notation editor MuseScore (MS). \nHe checked it against both BGA and NBA (Bach-Gesellschaft Ausgabe and Neue Bach-Ausgabe), \nif there was any reasonable doubt for it, and even found and improved a couple of mistakes that way (&lt;10).\nSolely for performance reasons, he also applied many hidden (grey) extras in MS to make the scores and its phrasing \nsound as realistic as possible; hidden fermatas, tempo changes, breath pauses, phrasing, note-cutbacks, etc. \nThis was all done to &#39;humanize&#39; the playback and make it sound like a real choir performance (without words), \nand given the technical limitations at that time (2016-2018). \nAlso see the <a href=\"https://gertim-alberda.com/chorales/info.html\">Info</a> tab on his website.</p>\n<p>The full corpus resides on Gertim Alberda’s <a href=\"https://gertim-alberda.com/chorales\">dedicated website</a>. \nThe scores there have synchronized play back (synthesized and human performances) available \nand can be downloaded in various formats (mscz/xml/midi/mp3/pdf). \n<a href=\"https://gertim-alberda.com/chorales/BachChorales/B288.html\">Here is an example</a> of his playback page. \nHis intention is to have only human performances available (YT videos and/or mp3’s) for all the scores, \nbut that is still an ongoing process \n(see the <a href=\"https://gertim-alberda.com/chorales/changelog_bach_chorales.html\">changelog</a> on his website). \nHe has agreed to share his MS files under a <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\">Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0</a> license. \nThe license prohibits the use of the scores for any commercial purpose, including the training of machine learning models for use in commercial products.</p>\n<h2 id=\"contents\">Contents</h2>\n<p>The &quot;mother of all datasets&quot; is available as two versions, each contained in a separate folder:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>original_complete</code>: Gertim Alberda&#39;s original MuseScore files converted to uncompressed \nMuseScore 3 format (<code>.mscx</code>)</li>\n<li><code>vocal_parts_only</code>: Alternative version of the dataset containing no instrumental parts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"version-history\">Version history</h2>\n<p>See the <a href=\"https://github.com/johentsch/389_chorale_settings/releases\">GitHub releases</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"questions-suggestions-corrections-bug-reports\">Questions, Suggestions, Corrections, Bug Reports</h2>\n<p>Please <a href=\"https://github.com/johentsch/389_chorale_settings/issues\">create an issue</a> and/or feel free to fork and submit pull requests.</p>\n<h2 id=\"license\">License</h2>\n<p>Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License (<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</a>).</p>\n",
